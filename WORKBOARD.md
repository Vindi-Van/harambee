# WORKBOARD

## Now
- Add GitHub execution dispatcher factory in `packages/oga/src/execution/github/createGitHubExecutionDispatcher.ts`.
- Wire export path and validate build/test pass for dispatcher composition.

## Next
- Integrate factory usage into `runtimeBindings.ts` transition path.
- Add error classification hooks (retriable vs non-retriable) for GitHub handler failures.
- Run `npm run check` and open next PR.

## Blocked
- None.
